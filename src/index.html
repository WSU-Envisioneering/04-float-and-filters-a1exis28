      <h1>History of Puerto Rico</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Puerto Rico has a rich history that dates back to the Taíno people, the island's original inhabitants. 
        In 1493, Christopher Columbus claimed Puerto Rico for Spain, leading to Spanish colonization and the establishment of San Juan in 1521. 
        The island became a key military outpost for Spain in the Caribbean. 
        In 1898, following the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States. 
        Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship in 1917, but the island remains a U.S. territory with limited self-governance. 
        Over the years, Puerto Rico has faced economic challenges, natural disasters like Hurricane Maria in 2017, and ongoing debates about its political status.</p>
