        In 1898, following the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States. 
        Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship in 1917, but the island remains a U.S. territory with limited self-governance. 
        Over the years, Puerto Rico has faced economic challenges, natural disasters like Hurricane Maria in 2017, and ongoing debates about its political status.</p>
